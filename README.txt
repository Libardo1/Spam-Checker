I have only implemented the makedictionary function in te spellchecker.py file. You can check the function by using "python spellchecker.py" , putting the spam and easy_ham folders in current folder. This also require the beautifulsoup library that I have included with this submission. Thanks for this great course and being a great TA and Professor.
